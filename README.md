[This is a good excuse](https://blog.janestreet.com/advent-of-fpga-challenge-2025/) to play with Rust and [Chisel 7](https://github.com/chipsalliance/chisel/releases/tag/v7.0.0), and see how [ChiselSim](https://www.chisel-lang.org/api/latest/chisel3/simulator/index.html) is doing nowadays as the replacement for (the [now deprecated](https://www.chisel-lang.org/docs/appendix/migrating-from-chiseltest)) [chiseltest](https://github.com/ucb-bar/chiseltest).

Run the Rust reference code: `cd rust_reference && cargo run --bin day1 ../inputs/day1.txt`
